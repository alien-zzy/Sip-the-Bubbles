## Introduction

In *Sip the bubble*, your goal is to collect as many pearls as possible by using your straw’s suction power to draw them in.
Your suction power depletes over time, and you must manage your energy to avoid running out before you’ve collected enough pearls.

---

## Gameplay

- **Objective:** Collect pearls by using your straw to suck them in, all while managing energy and avoiding obstacles.
- **Energy Management:** Your suction power is limited, and it slowly recharges over time.
- **Obstacles:** Bubbles and other objects in the environment will slow you down or block your way.
- **Score:** Each pearl you collect adds to your score. The goal is to collect as many as possible!

## Controls

- **Press F to insert straw:** Insert the straw into the bubble tea to begin collecting pearls. The straw will move toward the target position when activated.
- **Press Q to stop insert:** Stops the straw from moving forward and halts the insertion process.
- **press R to shake the cup:** Shake the cup to change the positioning of pearls or affect their movement, adding some unpredictability to the gameplay.
- **Press ESC to return to the initial state:** Pressing the ESC key will reset the game to the initial state, allowing you to start over or exit certain activities.
- **Spacebar:** Press to activate suction and start drawing pearls toward your straw.
- **Energy Bar:** Monitor your energy usage. Energy depletes when using suction and recharges over time.

## Hints & Tips

- **Use Precision:** Small, accurate movements are often more effective than full suction power.
- **Manage Your Energy:** Wait for your energy to recharge between suction uses. Don’t waste it all at once!
- **Timing Is Key:** Observe the pearl’s movement patterns and use suction at the right moment.
- **Avoid Obstacles:** Be cautious of bubbles and other objects that might block your straw or slow you down.
